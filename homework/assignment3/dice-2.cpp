 * * Description:This programs allows 2 people to play a simple dice game.
 *   This game will alternate between players until one of them has won.The rules are as follows:
 *
 *   Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls two dice:
 *
 *   If no 1s are rolled, the sum of the dice is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
 *   If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
 *   If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing for that round and it becomes the next player's turn.
 *   If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and it becomes the next player's turn.
